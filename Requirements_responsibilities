Drvtricks Reloaded - Requirements and Task Assignment
(Optimized for persistence across reboot)

Installer:
- Not persistent
- testsigning entries
- "Unpacking" appcertdll
- "Unpacking" driver
- Appcertdll installation
- Ntshutdownsystem

Loader:
- Execution temporary
- Image must be persistent because it loads driver
- Loader itself does not ensure persistence due to temporary execution
- Registry entry is persistent because loader is first code of drvtricks reloaded project to be run
- Must not contain driver to avoid impossible containment circle (driver contains appcertdll contains driver --> ???)
- Contains code to install and load driver

Driver:
- Execution persistent
- Image is itself persistent because execution is permanent
- Must be able to recreate both itself and appcertdll at any time
- Contains code to ensure "integrity" of testsigning entries and appcertdll entry
- Obtain and prepare nonpagedpoolexecute memory for callbacks and irp dispatch
- Attach to mouse and keyboard device stack
- Install callback routines for testsigning and appcertdlls entry
