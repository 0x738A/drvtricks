Drvtriks reloaded installer:

- On launch seem legit and display gui (pose as driverloader? =D )

- Write dll and service registry, and testsigning entries

- Copy appcertdll to system32/wbem, use space at end

- Make wchar 0 in appcertdlls value name

- After gui exit remove gui and stay alive (attempt running copied dll with ntcreateuserprocess?)

- after timeout do ntshutdownsystem

- In appcertdlls dll load driver exactly once

- If exists, driver should remove ntbtlog.txt!! (Better, find what boot entry makes windows create bootlog!)

- Appcertdlls, what about minimal safemode? (Alternatives to load admin-rights usermode code then?)

- Temporarily patch ntquerysysteminformation (patch for usermode-scantools) Codeintegrity info class, find which call in which process allows explorer.exe to show watermark, find what makes frst64 find testsigning info, let driver alter (no hooking!) systemstartoptions key value)

- The usual things such as driver recreates everything if missing/altered by means of notification routines
That is both files, all startup entries, testsigning entry

- Represent everything in both um/km with classes and class connections --> work towards refactoring into patterns!
