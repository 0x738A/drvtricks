(drvtricks driver has to be renamed into payload.sys for loading by antidse.exe)
todo:
make phoenix behavior working(when system ist shut down, install registry entry "setupexecute" for project1.exe):

solve by polling: call exqueueworkitem in driverentry, in workroutine poll for svchost.exe existing, if not, write reg value, or poll for any running services(difficult, services in ring3 mostly)


or solve by sync: call exqueueworkitem in drv entry, in workroutine do kewaitforsingleobject on svchost.exe or any windows shutdown event


or solve by callback: try to register object callback or set a createprocessnotifyroutine (must set code integrity flag on PE header of drvtricks) and look for process exit of svchost.exe


situations not covered: if user presses powerbutton(long).
